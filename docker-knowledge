1.getting started

-what is docker?
>docker is a tool for running applications in an isolated environment
>similar to virtual machine
>app run in same environment
>just works
>standard for software deployment

-container vs vm
>containers are an abstraction at the app layer that packages code and dependencies together.
multiple containers can run on the same machine and share the os kernel with other containers, each
running as isolated processes in user space.

>virtual machines (vms) are an abstraction of physical hardware tuning one server into many servers.
the hypervisor turning one server into many servers. the hypervisor allows multiple vms to run on a single 
machine. each vm includes a full copy of an operating system, the application, necessary binaries and libraries - 
taking up tens of gbs. vms can also be slow to boot.

-benefits
>run container in seconds instead of minutes
>less resources results less disk space
>uses less memory
>does not need full os
>deployment
>testing

-installation process
>https://docs.docker.com/install/

-verify docker installation


2.containers

image:
>image is a template for creating and environment of your choice
>snapshot
>has everything need to run your apps
>os, software, app code


container:
>running instance of an image

-pulling docker images
https://hub.docker.com

$docker pull nginx
$docker images

-running containers
$docker run nginx:latest
$docker container ls
$docker run -d nginx:latest (run container in detached mode!)
$docker ps 

-exposing ports
$docker stop [container_id]
$docker run -d -p 8080:80 nginx:latest

-exposing multiple ports
$docker run -d -p 3000:80 -p 8080:80 nginx:latest
$docker ps

-managing containers
$docker ps
$docker stop [container_id] or [container_name]
$docker start [container_id] or [container_name]
$docker ps -a
$docker rm [container_id] (deletes container!)
$docker rm $(docker ps -aq) [removes all containers!]
$docker rm -f $(docker ps -aq) 

-naming containers
$docker ps
$docker run --name website -d -p 3000:80 -p 8080:80 nginx:latest
$docker ps
$docker stop website
or
$docker start website

-formatting output of docker ps command
$docker ps --format="..."
